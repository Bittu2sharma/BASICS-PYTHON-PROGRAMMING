        "In recent years, terrorism has taken a whole new dimension and becoming a global issue because of widespread attacks and comparatively high number of fatalities. Understanding the attack characteristics of most active groups and subsequent statistical analysis is, therefore, an important aspect toward counterterrorism support in the present situation. In this thesis, we use a variety of data mining techniques and descriptive analysis to determine, examine and characterize threat level from top ten most active and violent terrorist groups and then use machine learning algorithms to avail intelligence toward counterterrorism support. We use historical data of terrorist attacks that took place around the world between 1970 to 2016 from the open-source Global Terrorism Database and the primary objective is to translate terror incident related information into actionable intelligence. In other words, we chase the trajectory of terrorism in the present context with statistical methods and derive insights that can be useful.\n",
        "\n",
        "A major part of this thesis is based on supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. We use Apriori algorithm to discover patterns in various groups. From the discovered patterns, one of the interesting patterns we find is that ISIL is more likely to attack other terrorists (non-state militia) with bombing/explosion while having resulting fatalities between 6 to 10 whereas Boko Haram is more likely to target civilians with explosives, without suicide attack and resulting fatalities more than 50. Within the supervised machine learning context, we extend the previous research in time-series forecasting and make use of TBATS, ETS, Auto Arima and Neural Network model. We predict the future number of attacks in Afghanistan and SAHEL region, and the number of fatalities in Iraq at a monthly frequency. From time-series forecasting, we prove two things; the model that works best in one time-series data may not be the best in another time-series data, and that the use of ensemble significantly improves forecasting accuracy from base models. Similarly, in the classification modeling part, previous research lacks the use of algorithms that are recently developed. We also extend the previous research in binary classification problem and make use of a cutting-edge LightGBM algorithm to predict the probability of suicide attack. Our model achieves 96% accuracy in terms of AUC and correctly classifies “Yes” instances of suicide attacks with 86.5% accuracy."

With recent development in machine learning algorithms and access to open source data and software, there are plenty of opportunities to correctly understand historical terrorist attacks and prevent the future conflicts. In the last decade, terrorist attacks have been increased significantly:\n",

        "After September 2001 attacks, USA and other powerful nations have carried out major operations to neutralize the power and spread of known and most violent terrorist groups within the targeted region such as in Afghanistan, Iraq and most recently in Syria. It’s also worth mentioning that the United Nations already have ongoing peacekeeping missions in conflicted regions around the world for a long time. However number of terror attacks continues to rise and in fact, it is almost on a peak in the last 5 years. This leads to a question why terrorism is becoming unstoppable despite the continued efforts. Understanding and interpreting the attack characteristics of relevant groups in line with their motivations to do so can reflect the bigger picture. An extensive research by (Heger, 2010) supports this argument and suggests that a group’s political intentions are revealed when we examine who or what it chooses to attack.\n",

        "1. Risk Assessment and Mitigation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Insight: Visualizations such as the number of terrorist attacks per year, region, and country can help identify high-risk areas and time periods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Solution: Businesses can use this information to assess and mitigate risks by avoiding investments or operations in high-risk regions during periods of heightened terrorist activity. They can also enhance security measures and develop contingency plans in areas identified as high-risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Resource Allocation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Insight: The pair plot and other visualizations can show patterns in the types of attacks, targets, and weapons used.\n",
        "\n",
        "Solution: Governments and security agencies can allocate resources more effectively by focusing on the most common types of attacks and weapons. For example, if the data shows a high prevalence of bombings in a particular region, resources can be directed towards bomb detection and disposal units.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Policy Making:\n",
        "\n",
